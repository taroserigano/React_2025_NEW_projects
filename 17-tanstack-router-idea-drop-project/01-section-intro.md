# Section Intro

So we learned how to use React Router v7 in both framework and declarative mode. Now I want to show you how to use TanStack Router. This is a powerful and flexible routing library for React applications. I want to show you how to use it in a file-based routing system, while building a project called "IdeaDrop" where you can post startup ideas and side hustles. This will use the JSON Server package on the backend which will give us a quick mock REST API. This is a great way to learn how to use TanStack Router and learn more about TanStack Query, and it will be a fun project to work on. After we learn about the router and get the frontend down, we will start to dabble in the backend and MERN stack development as a bonus. It's completely up to you if you want to follow along with that part or not.

As far as lessons, we'll go over what TanStack Router is, and how to use it. We'll then go over the project setup. I will show you how to create routes including nested and dynamic routes. Like React Router, TanStack also has a concept of loaders to load data. We'll use that along with TanStack Query. We will look at layout routes. We'll continue on with our IdeaDrop project as well.
