# Mock REST API

I want to setup a backend to make requests to to get some data. We will use JSON placeholder, which creates a mock REST API for us. This is a great way to test our application without having to set up a real backend. We will be using the following endpoints:

- `GET /ideas` - Get all ideas
- `GET /ideas/:id` - Get a single idea
- `POST /ideas` - Create a new idea
- `PUT /ideas/:id` - Update an idea
- `DELETE /ideas/:id` - Delete an idea

This is a very common structure for what we call a REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. This allows for scalability and flexibility in web applications.

A REST API is a way to communicate with a server using HTTP requests. It allows us to create, read, update, and delete data on the server, which if you think about it, is what is at the heart of most applications.

In a future section, I will show you how to create your own backend REST API using Node.js, Express and MongoDB and we will turn this into a MERN app. But for now, we will use JSON placeholder to test our application.

Install JSON server by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -d json-server
```

Now create a new file called `src/data/db.json` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json

}

I will also add this in the resource files for this lesson.

## JSON Server Script

Now we need to create a script to run JSON Server. Open the `package.json` file and add the following script:

```json
"scripts": {
  //...,
  "json-server": "json-server  src/data/db.json --port 5000"
}
```

Now in your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm run json-server
```

This will start the JSON Server and you can go to `http://localhost:5000/ideas` to see the data. You can also use Postman or any other API client to test the API. You can also use the browser to test the API.

Leave this running and we will move on to the next step.
