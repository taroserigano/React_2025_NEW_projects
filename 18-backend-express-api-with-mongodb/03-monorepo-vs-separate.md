# Monorepo vs Separate Repositories

When building a full stack application, you have two main options for organizing your code: using a monorepo or separate repositories. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on your specific needs and preferences.

## Monorepo

A monorepo places both the frontend and backend codebases (and potentially more) in a single Git repository, typically with a structure like this:

project-root/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── .git/

#### Pros

- Single source of truth: One repo to clone, install, and manage.
- Simplified local development: Easier to use tools like concurrently to spin up both apps together.
- Synchronized versioning: One commit can reflect changes across frontend and backend.
- Shared tooling: Common config for ESLint, Prettier, Husky, etc.

#### Cons

- More complex deployment setups: Services like Vercel or Heroku require extra configuration to point to subdirectories.
- Harder to separate access/permissions: All code is exposed together.
- Potential for coupling: Teams working in the same repo might unintentionally introduce tight dependencies.

## Separate Repositories

In this model, your frontend and backend live in completely separate Git repositories.

Your project structure would look like this:

project-root/
├── idea-drop/ (Git repo)
└── idea-drop-api/ (Git repo)

#### Pros

- Simpler CI/CD and deployment: Tools like Vercel and Netlify expect separate repos for frontend projects.
- Better isolation: Each app can evolve independently with separate Git histories, issues, and permissions.
- Team separation: Useful when frontend and backend are managed by different teams or contributors.

#### Cons

- Extra repo management: You’ll need to clone/pull both repos and manage two separate issue trackers.
- Harder to keep in sync: Changes that touch both frontend and backend require PRs in two places.
- Redundant tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, etc. need to be configured separately.

Ultimately, the choice between a monorepo and separate repositories depends on your team's workflow, the size of your project, and how you plan to deploy your applications.

With that said, for IdeaDrop, I think keeping them separate is the best option, especially since some of you are beginners. I think a monorepo may cause a lot of confuction. Alos, we will be deploying the frontend to Vercel and the backend to Render. So we will need to have separate repos for that.
