# MongoDB Compass & Importing Data

As we saw in the last lesson, you can see and manage your data in MongoDB Atlas, however, there is a better way to manage your data in MongoDB. You can use MongoDB Compass, which is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) desktop application. It allows you to visualize your data, run queries, and manage your database without writing any code.

This is optional, but it is highly recommended to use MongoDB Compass to manage your data. You can download it from the [MongoDB Compass Download Page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

Once you install it and open it, it will ask for a URI. Go back to your MongoDB Atlas account and click on the "Connect" button. Then click on "Compass". You will see a connection string that looks like this:

```bash
mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.gwdxwmc.mongodb.net/
```

Add this to Compass and click on "Connect".

You will see your databases on the left side. Click on the ideadrop database and you will see the idea that we just added.

You can also create new ideas from here and manage your data. You can also run queries to find specific data.

## Importing Data

I want to add all the ideas that we were using with JSON Server. You should still have your `idea-drop-ui/src/data/db.jsom` file. We need to edit that a bit. We don't want to have the ids in it because MongoDB will create them for us. So we need to remove the `id` field from each idea. Change the structure to look like the following and add it to a new file called `ideas.json` and save it to your backend folder at `idea-drop-api/data-import/ideas.json`. Do not edit the original `db.json` file.

```json

Now open Compass and select your database. Click on the `ideas` collection and then click on the "Collection-> Import Data" option in the main menu and select the `ideas.json` file. Compass will automatically detect the JSON format and import the data into your collection.
